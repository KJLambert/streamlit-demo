# Welcome to my Streamlit project
I decided to check out streamlit as an app deployment tool. I wanted to understand how app deployment would work in combination with using uv as the package manager. This project may not launch a particularly useful app, but is meant to serve as a template that I can refer to.

# Project setup
1. Initiate an empty github repo
2. With uv installed on my system, run `uv init`
3. Get uv into my env with `uv add streamlit`
